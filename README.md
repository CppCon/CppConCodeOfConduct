{{conf-name}} Code of Conduct
=============================

This is {{conf-name}}'s "fork" of the CppCon / PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides.

No changes are final until approved by the {{conf-name}} Chair / Staff and versions in place for a given year will be clearly
marked, the website contents on {{conf-hostname}} will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
