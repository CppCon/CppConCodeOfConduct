cppcon-code-of-conduct
=====================

This is CppCon's "fork" of the PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides. 

No changes are final until approved by the CppCon Chair / Staff and versions in place for a given year will be clearly
marked, the website contents on cppcon.org will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
