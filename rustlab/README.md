RustLab Code of Conduct
=============================

This is RustLab's "fork" of the CppCon / PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides.

No changes are final until approved by the RustLab Chair / Staff and versions in place for a given year will be clearly
marked, the website contents on rustlab.it will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
